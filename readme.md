# C++ SDL2 Build it from Scratch

This is a personal project I am working on to familiarize myself some with C++ and SDL2 while doing the thing I enjoy most, making a game.

# Progress
Currently still in very early stages though depending on time and how things go we will see how far it progresses. Currently have a basic playable character, environment, and just implemented projectiles. Plans are uncertain but some kind of puzzle exploration rpg, or other such similar game is the plan.

## Installation

purely code format no executable like with a Unity project at this time so I recommend Visual Studio as it is what I am working in or any other IDE you are familiar with that you know runs C++

Also note that some setup is required for SDL2 to work. The following links to the tutorial series I have been following to get me started and goes through the setup at least for visual studios, however it should be similar in other IDE's. Note: there is another video in the series for MAC users
